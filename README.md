# SCHOOL-DISTRICT-ANALYISIS
Python script for School District Analysis


## Overview
The object of this project is to retreive and repeat the School-District analysis for the Thomas High School, after deleting the ninth grade scores. I applied the same method with the remaining data to obtain new results that may have more consistency after knowing there were missing some scores on the ninth grade that would have affected the innicial analyisis.
